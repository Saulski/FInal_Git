This Project is an implementation of the Use of Hardware components under Embedded systems, 

My Microwave Project consisted of a TI Msp Microcontroller that conducted a wireless connection between wifi modules
that transferred data such as Temperature, Speed of an acceleromator(For Microwave speed adjusting),
and was delivered to a main TI Msp Microcontroller that processed the incoming data within an LCD screen while also 
processing user input for "Cook Time" which controlled the duration of the spinning plate within the microwave.
There were also preselect option for the specific foods such as "Popcorn", "Quick reheat", "Noodles", and etc.

This project was coded using C, Code Composer (TI), Vscode, and Github
